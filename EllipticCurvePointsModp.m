function Points = EllipticCurvePointsModp(a, b, p)
% Points = EllipticCurvePointsModp(a, b, p)
% Input: Two integers a, b, and a prime p > 3. It is assumed that 4a^3 + 27b^2 is nonzero, so that the associated elliptic curve
% y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
% is nonsingular.
% Output: Points, a 2 column vector listing all points belonging to this
% elliptic curve mod p, including the point at infinity. Each row of
% points will be a point on this elliptic curve.
% The method will simply run through all possible values for x (mod p) and
% then do a brute force search for any yâ€™s that satisfy the equation.
