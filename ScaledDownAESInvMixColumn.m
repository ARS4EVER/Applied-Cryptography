function OutStateHex = ScaledDownAESInvMixColumn(InStateHex)
% OutStateHex = ScaledDownAESInvMixColumn(InStateHex)
% Input: InStateHex = 2 by 2 matrix of single hex digits (i.e.,
% nibbles).
% Output: OutStateHex = 2 by 2 matrix of single hex digits (i.e.,
% nibbles), resulting from the Inv Mix Column transformation of the scaled-down
% AES algorithm.
%This transformation is a matrix multiplication of the input state nibble matrix
%with the 2 by 2 nibble matrix M:
% X^3 + 1    X
% X         X^3 + 1
% In hex notation, this matrix is:
% 9 2
% 2 9
% To construct the entries of the product matrix, we need to use the
% definition of matrix multiplication since nibble addition (NibbleXOR) and
% nibble multiplication (NibleMult) are not the default operations used to
% compute matrix products.
