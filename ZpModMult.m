function fgx = ZpModMult(fx, gx, mx, p)  
% fgx = ZpModMult(fx, gx, mx, p)  
% Program for multiplying elements in Z_p[X] (mod m).  
% Inputs are three vectors representing polynomials: fx, gx, mx, and p a prime number.  
% We assume that  
% the first components of fx, gx, mx are nonzero, unless the polynomial is  
% zero, in which case [0] is used to represent it. mx is assumed  
% nonconstant.  
% Output will be a vector fgx, representing the produce of the two  
% polynomials fx by gx, reduced mod mx.  
% All polynomials are stored as vectors in the following format:  
% -X^3 + 3X^2 + 1 ----> [1 3 0 1]  

% First multiply polynomials as usual in Z_p[X]:  
fgxRaw = ZpPolyMult(fx, gx, p);  

% Now apply the division algorithm and take fgx to be the remainder:  
[qx fgx] = ZpDivAlg(fgxRaw, mx, p);
