function OutStateHex = ScaledDownAESmixColumn(InStateHex)
% OutStateHex = ScaledDownAESmixColumn(InStateHex)
% Input: InStateHex = 2 by 2 matrix of single hex digits (i.e.,
% nibbles).
% Output: OutStateHex = 2 by 2 matrix of single hex digits (i.e.,
% nibbles), resulting from the Mix Column transformation of the scaled-down
% AES algorithm.
%This transformation is a matrix multiplication of the input state nibble matrix
%with the 2 by 2 nibble matrix M:
% 1  x^2
% x^2 1
% In hex notation, this matrix is:
% 1  4
% 4  1
% To construct the entries of the product matrix, we need to use the
% definition of matrix multiplication since nibble addition (NibbleXOR) and
% nibble multiplication (NibbleMult) are not the default operations used to
% compute matrix products.
M = ['1','4'; '4','1'];
