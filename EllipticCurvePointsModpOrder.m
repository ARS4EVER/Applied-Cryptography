function Order = EllipticCurvePointsModpOrder(P, a, b, p)
% Order = EllipticCurvePointsModpOrder(P, a, b, p)
% Input: Two integers a, b, and a prime p > 3. It is assumed that 4a^3 + 27b^2 is nonzero, so that the associated elliptic curve E:
% y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
% is nonsingular. The first input P is a length 2 vector of mod p integers
% representing a point on the elliptic curve
% Output: Order, a positive integer representing the order of P in the
% abelian group E (mod p). The order is computed by brute force: simply
% continuing to compute the sum P+P+P+... until we obtain the identity
% (inf, inf). Although it is known that this order divides |E|, the latter
% is nontrivial to compute
